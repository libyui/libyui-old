/**
 * ComboBox (or "drop down box", "drop down selection"); may be editable.
 *
 * A widget with a drop-down list of predefined values to select from.
 * Optionally, this widget can be created in "editable" mode which means that
 * the user can freely enter any text.
 *
 * In non-editable mode, a ComboBox works very much like a SelectionBox that
 * uses fewer screen space. In that mode, it is recommended to use
 * selectedItem() to retrieve its current value and selectItem() to set it.
 *
 * In editable mode, a ComboBox is more like an InputField with a list to pick
 * predefined values from (for less typing). In that mode, it is recommended to
 * use value() and setValue().
 *
 * In either mode, it might be dangerous to use the iterators the
 * (itemsBegin(), itemsEnd()) the base class (YSelectionWidget) provides to
 * find the currently selected item: The items' "selected" flag may or may not
 * be up to date. YComboBox::selectedItem() makes sure they are up to date.
