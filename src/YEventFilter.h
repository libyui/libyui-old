/**
 * Abstract base class to filter events.
 *
 * This class can be used to examine events just before they are delivered to
 * the application. This is most useful for higher-level widgets or for
 * libraries that need to react to certain events and either consume them, have
 * them delivered unchanged to the application, or exchange an event with
 * another one.
 *
 * A YEventFilter belongs to one specific dialog. Each dialog can have any
 * number of event filters. Each of those event filters is called (its
 * YEventFilter::filter() method) for each event inside
 * YDialog::waitForEvent(). The order in which event filters are called is
 * undefined.
 *
 * YEventFilter objects should be created with 'new' (on the heap). Since an
 * YEventFilter registers itself with its dialog, the dialog will delete it in
 * its destructor if it still exists after all child widgets are deleted.
 *
 * Thus, it is safe to store a pointer to an YEventFilter until the
 * corresponding dialog is deleted. After that, the pointer becomes invalid.
 *
 * See YHelpButtonHandler in YDialog.cc for an example.

     * YUINoDialogException if there is no dialog).

     *
     * This method can inspect the event it receives.  Hint: event->widget()
     * is typically the most interesting information.
     *
     * This method can react on individual events and
     *
     *   - consume the event (i.e., return 0)
     *   - pass the event through unchanged (simply return the event)
     *   - create a new event (typically based on data in the received event).
     *
     * If 0 or a new event (another value than 'event') is returned, the old
     * event is deleted. If a value different from 'event' or 0 is returned,
     * that value is assumed to be a pointer to a newly created event. The
     * dialog will assume ownership of that event and delete it when
     * appropriate.
     *
     * Note: Never delete 'event' in this method! Return 0 or a new event
     * instead; the caller will take care of deleting the old event.
