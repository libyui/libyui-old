     *    - if $DISPLAY is *not* set and stdout is a TTY
     *    - Qt and Gtk are not available and stdout is a TTY

     *    - '--ncurses', or

     *    - 'gtk',
     *    - 'ncurses', or
     *    - 'qt'
     *
     * If a command-line switch is given to the program, the
     * setting from the environment variable will be overridden
     * by the UI-plugin chosen with the switch.
     *
     * If the user-selected UI-plugin is not installed on the
     * system, an installed UI-plugin will be chosen by the
     * above criteria.
