Run the examples by typing:

   y2base ./<test>.ycp qt

to use the graphical YaST2 user interface  (the Qt UI)
or for the text based YaST2 user interface (the NCurses UI):

   y2base ./<test>.ycp ncurses

Depending on your system setup, you might have to specify the absolute
path for the "y2base" command. At the time of this writing, this should be
   /usr/lib/YaST2/bin/y2base


Example:

   y2base ./ProgressBar1.ycp qt
