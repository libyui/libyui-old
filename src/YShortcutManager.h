     * Note: This may or may not work. There is no general solution to that
     * problem. This method tries its best, but you may end up with widgets
     * that don't have any ( more ) shortcut.
     *
     * Why? Just picture the following ( admittedly pathologic ) situation:
     *
     * [& OK]
     * [& OK]
     * [& OK]
     *
     * This will result in something like this:
     *
     * [& OK]
     * [O& K]
     * [OK]
     *
     * I.e. the first OK button will retain its preferred shortcut ( 'O' ), the
     * second OK button's shortcut will be reassigned to 'K' and the third
     * won't get any - there are simply not enough eligible shortcut
     * characters.
     *
     * This may even fail in much less pathological situations. This example is
     * only supposed to give you a general idea why not to blindly rely on
     * automatic shortcut resolving.
     *
     * It's always best to resolve conflicts manually. This will generally
     * result in much better shortcuts: Easier to memorize, less chance of
     * picking characters that cannot really do a good job showing their
     * shortcut like very narrow characters ( .e.g., 'i' ) or descender
     * characters ( e.g., 'g', 'p', 'q' - imagine those underlined! ).
