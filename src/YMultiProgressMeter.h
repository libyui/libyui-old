/**
 * MultiProgressMeter: Progress bar with several segments that can indicate
 * progress individually. This is useful to display progress of several
 * activities that might not necessarily all be done in sequence.
 *
 * A common example is installing packages from several CDs: Each CD would get
 * a separate segment. Each segment's size would be proportional to the amount
 * of data to be installed from that CD. This visualizes at the same time
 * (a) how many CDs are involved
 * (b) how much in proportion is to be expected from each CD
 * (c) whether or not a specific CD is finished.
 *
 * Visual example (horizontal MultiProgressMeter):
 *
 *     [=============...] [===] [......] [.]
 *
 * This corresponds to 4 CDs:
 *
 * CD #1: A lot of packages are to be installed from this CD, and a fair amount
 *        of those are already installed, but some are still missing.
 * CD #2: Some packages were installed from this, but this CD is finished.
 * CD #3: Quite some packages are to be installed from this CD.
 * CD #4: Very few packages are to be installed from this CD.
 *
 * As can be seen from this simple example, this widget can visualize a lot of
 * complex information at the same time in a very natural way.
 *
 *
 * This is an optional widget, i.e. not all UIs support it.
