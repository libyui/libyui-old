/**
 * Container widget for dialog buttons that abstracts the button order
 * depending on the desktop environment.
 *
 * KDE and Windows arrange dialog buttons like this:
 *
 *     [OK] [Apply] [Cancel] [Custom1] [Custom2] ... [Help]
 *
 *     [Continue] [Cancel]
 *
 *     [Yes] [No]
 *
 *
 * GNOME and MacOS arrange them like this:
 *
 *     [Help] [Custom1] [Custom2] ... [Apply] [Cancel] [OK]
 *
 *     [Cancel] [Continue]
 *
 *     [No] [Yes]
 *
 *
 * This class provides the abstraction to use whatever layout is more
 * appropriate in the current environment. The application creates the buttons
 * as child widgets of a YButtonBox (rather than a YHBox) and leaves the button
 * order to the YButtonBox.
 *
 * Each of the standard buttons ([OK], [Apply], [Cancel], [Help]) needs to have
 * a button role properly assigned.
 *
 * If set up properly (see YApplication::setDefaultFunctionKey()), known button
 * labels will be assigned an appropriate role:
 *
 *     [OK]			F10
 *     [Continue] -> [OK]	F10
 *     [Yes]      -> [OK]	F10
 *     [Accept]   -> [OK]	F10
 *     [Next]     -> [OK]	F10
 *
 *     [Cancel]			F9
 *     [No]       -> [Cancel]	F9
 *
 *     [Help]			F1
 *
 * Buttons with nonstandard labels that act in such a role need to be
 * explicitly assigned that role:
 *
 *     [Print ] [Cancel] [Help]
 *     [Delete] [Cancel] [Help]
 *
 * Those [Print] or [Delete] buttons act as [OK] buttons (the "yes, do it"
 * action of that dialog). Call YPushButton::setButtonRole( YOkButton )
 * explicitly for them.
 *
 *
 * YButtonBox widgets only accept YPushButton child widgets. Otherwise an
 * exception is thrown.
 *
 * If there is more than one button, one of the child buttons needs to have the
 * [OK] role, and another needs to have the [Cancel] role. Otherwise an
 * exception is thrown.
