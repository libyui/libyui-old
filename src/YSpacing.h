     * time. But it can be stretchable and have a size at the same time, in
     * which case the specified size acts very much like a minimal size - but
     * not exactly, since YLayoutBox will reduce Spacings first before other
     * widgets have to be resized below their preferred size.
     *
     * 'layoutUnits' is specified in abstract UI units where a main window
     * (800x600 pixels in the Qt UI) corresponds to a 80x25 window.
