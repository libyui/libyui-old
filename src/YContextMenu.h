/**
 * ContextMenu: Similar to PushButton, but with several actions: Upon clicking
 * on a ContextMenu (or activating it with the keyboard), a pop-up menu opens
 * where the user can activate an action. Menu items in that pop-up menu can
 * have submenus (that will pop up in separate pop-up menus).
 *
 * Internally, this widget is more similar to the Tree widget. The difference
 * is that it does not keep a "selected" status, but triggers an action right
 * away, just like a PushButton. Like PushButton, ContextMenu sends an event
 * right away when the user selects an item (clicks on a menu item or activates
 * it with the keyboard). Items that have a submenu never send an event, they
 * simply open their submenu when activated.
 *
 * Note: unlike other widgets, this one is not created via YWidgetFactory
 * or YOptionalWidgetFactory but with YApplication::openContextMenu()
